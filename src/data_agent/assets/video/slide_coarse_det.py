"""Coarse slide-frame detection from H.264 bitrate rhythm (no full decode).

Idea (validated on the phase2 briefing videos): an H.264 P-frame encodes only
the *residual* against its reference, so a held-still slide costs ~50 bytes per
frame while a slide change -- new content with no usable reference -- explodes to
thousands of bytes for the ~0.5 s the transition/animation lasts. So the byte
size of each coded packet, read straight from the container with NO decoding,
traces a clean "static (small) <-> burst (big)" rhythm:

  * a run of CONSECUTIVE BIG packets  = a transition or an on-slide animation;
  * a run of small packets            = a settled, unchanging slide.

This is strictly more reliable than keying on I-frames: x264 inserts a forced
I-frame every keyint (=250 frames here) even when nothing changed -- a "fake"
keyframe surrounded by tiny packets. Because we trigger on byte BURSTS, those
fake keyframes fall inside a quiet stretch and produce no candidate, while a real
change that x264 coded as a plain P-frame (inside min-keyint) is still caught.

We deliberately favour RECALL over precision: every burst yields a candidate
frame, so a multi-step build/animation may emit several frames for one slide.
That is fine -- the candidates are meant to be fed to a multimodal LLM that does
the final same-slide dedup. ``min_quiet_s`` optionally folds bursts separated by
a short quiet gap (on-slide animation steps) into one slide; see its default.

Representative frame: for each (merged) burst we take the frame settled JUST
AFTER it -- "what the slide looks like once this change finished" -- and record
both that frame's real timestamp and the originating burst window.

Self-contained: ffprobe (bundled by the repo's ``static-ffmpeg`` dep) reads
packet sizes without decoding; PyAV decodes only the handful of frames actually
exported. This module does not depend on ``video.frames`` (which may be retired).
